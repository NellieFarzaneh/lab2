              I'm a hands on UX-designer who loves exploring how people think,
              feel and interact with digital experiences. I enjoy turnning
              complex problems infor clear and intuitive solutions, as well as
              experimenting with ideas that make products feel enjoyable and
              engaging, and also looks good. I like to learn new things with
              pototyping, reseraching and everything in between.

              When I was younger I lived in Skåne. There I studied animal health
              care. I chose this major as I have always had an interest and
              compassion for animals. I remember that I as a child always wanted
              to be around animals and was sad that my brother was allergic to
              fur animals, and was very jealous of friends and family members
              who had pets. My plan after Gymnasiet was to continue with animal
              related studies, such as veterinary medicine or animal welfare
              inspector. However, this meant I had to move to a city that I did
              not want to move to so after a lot of consideration I decided to
              start my IT journey as a interaction designer. I am currently
              studying my third, and last year, as an interaction designer at
              Linneus University in Kalmar. I found my interets for this program
              becuase of my boyfriend. When we met he was studying the same
              thing, and i was originally planning on studying economics. After
              seeing what my boyfriend did I was intrigued and started looking
              into the program myself. I found it very interesting and decided
              to apply.

          I also enjoy second hand shopping and going to thrift stores to find
          unique clothes and accessories. My new found hobby is crocheing. I
          find this very relaxing and rewarding as it gived me something
          meaningful to do as well as getting fun stuff to wear and use
          afterwards. I like the feeling of knowing I made it myself.

              My short term goal is to finish my studies and get my degree as an
              interaction designer. After that I would like to get a job within
              the field. I would like to work at a company with a sustainability
              focus. I would like my future working place to have a good work
              environment where I can learn and grow as a designer. A good
              workplace is important to me cause I want to feel good about
              coming to work everyday and working with my colleagues.
